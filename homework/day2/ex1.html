    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a cooking technique called <b>sous vide</b>. In <b>sous
            vide</b>
        cooking, you submerge
        the food (usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature
        you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes it as “ultra-low
        temperature poaching.”</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef's
        table,
        contact us before November 30.</p>

    <p>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have IMMUNITY ISSUES.</p>
