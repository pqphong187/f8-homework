        <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
        <p>
            This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>.
            In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a water bath that
            is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.
            In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as “ultra-low temperature poaching.”

            Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>.
            To reserve a seat at the chef's table, contact us before November 30.
